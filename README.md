# My Personal 42 Repo  

This repository contains my projects from the 42 programming curriculum. Each project demonstrates my growth in software development, algorithm design, and problem-solving, adhering to the rigorous coding standards of 42.  

## Projects Overview  

### **libft**  
A custom C library that replicates many standard library functions. This foundational project taught me memory management, pointer arithmetic, and modular code design.  

### **get_next_line**  
A program that reads a file line-by-line efficiently, showcasing my ability to handle file I/O and memory allocation in C.  

### **ft_printf**  
A reimplementation of the `printf` function in C, focusing on formatted output, modular code structure, and error handling.  

### **pipex**  
A Unix shell pipeline simulator that creates processes and handles inter-process communication using system calls.  

### **so_long**  
A 2D game implemented in C using the MiniLibX library. This project includes pathfinding, collision detection, and dynamic rendering.  

### **push_swap**  
An algorithmic project to sort data using two stacks with minimal operations, demonstrating my understanding of algorithm efficiency and complexity.  

### **philosophers**  
A simulation of the dining philosophers problem, focusing on multi-threading, synchronization, and avoiding deadlocks.  

## Skills Demonstrated  
- Proficiency in C programming  
- Memory management and debugging  
- Multi-threading and synchronization  
- Adherence to the 42 norminette coding standard  
- Low-level programming and algorithm design  

## How to Use
